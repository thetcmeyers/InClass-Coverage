Two basic functions, one to print the nth number in a fibonacci sequence and one to print the
result of the factorial of an input

Two basic testing schemes, one ran with python's unittest module; test by running the test_fibonacci.py file

The other ran with python's pytest module, ran with the pytest command on the file fibonacci.py
